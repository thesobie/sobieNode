const wednesdaySessions = await Session.getSessionsByDay(conferenceId, '2025-04-09');

// Get sessions by category
const studentSessions = await Session.getSessionsByCategory(conferenceId, 'Student Research');

// Get current active session
const activeSession = await Session.getCurrentSession();
```

### 3. ResearchPresentation Model (`ResearchPresentation.js`)
Comprehensive research paper and presentation tracking:

#### Key Features:
- **Research Classification**: Type, discipline, academic level
- **Author Management**: Multiple authors, roles, affiliations
- **Research Content**: Methodology, findings, contributions
- **Publication Tracking**: Journal submissions, publication status
- **Presentation Details**: Slides, duration, technical requirements

#### Sample Usage:
```javascript
// Get all student research
const studentResearch = await ResearchPresentation.getStudentResearch(2025);

// Search research by keywords
const aiResearch = await ResearchPresentation.searchResearch('artificial intelligence');

// Get research by author
const authorPapers = await ResearchPresentation.getByAuthor(userId);
```
