# 🛡️ Communication Safety System - SOBIE Research Database

## Overview
The SOBIE Research Database includes comprehensive safety measures to prevent **any real emails, SMS, or push notifications** from being sent to users during development and testing phases. Only the designated `TEST_USER_EMAIL` will receive communications.

## 🚫 What is BLOCKED in Development Mode

### ✅ **100% SAFE - NO REAL COMMUNICATIONS SENT**

- **📧 Emails**: All emails to real users are blocked and redirected to test email
- **📱 SMS/Text Messages**: All SMS communications are completely blocked
- **🔔 Push Notifications**: All push notifications are blocked and logged only
- **🔐 User Registration**: Welcome emails blocked for all real user accounts
- **🔑 Password Resets**: Reset emails blocked and logged instead
- **📋 Notifications**: All system notifications blocked in development

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)
```bash
# CRITICAL: Keep NODE_ENV=development to prevent real communications
NODE_ENV=development

# ONLY this email will receive redirected communications
TEST_USER_EMAIL=barrycumbie@gmail.com

# Safety switches (keep these settings for development)
EMAIL_SERVICE_ENABLED=false
SEND_TO_TEST_EMAIL=false
BLOCK_ALL_SMS=true
BLOCK_ALL_PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS=true
LOG_COMMUNICATION_ATTEMPTS=true
```

## 🛡️ Safety Systems Implemented

### 1. Email Safety Guard (`src/utils/communicationSafety.js`)
- **Intercepts ALL email attempts**
- **Blocks non-test emails** in development mode
- **Redirects to TEST_USER_EMAIL** if enabled
- **Logs all blocked communications** for audit

### 2. Safe Email Service (`src/services/emailService.js`)
- **Mock email service** in development mode
- **Real SMTP disabled** when EMAIL_SERVICE_ENABLED=false
- **Comprehensive logging** of all email attempts
- **Safe methods** for all email types (welcome, password reset, notifications)

### 3. Communication Safety Middleware (`src/middleware/communicationSafety.js`)
- **Intercepts user registration** processes
- **Blocks password reset** emails
- **Handles notification** preferences safely
- **Global safety headers** on all responses

### 4. SMS and Push Notification Guards
- **Complete SMS blocking** in development mode
- **Push notification interception** and logging
- **No external API calls** to SMS/push services

## 🧪 Testing the Safety System

### Automated Safety Test
The system includes comprehensive testing to verify safety measures:

```bash
node test-communication-safety.js
```

**Test Results Confirm:**
- ✅ All real emails blocked
- ✅ All SMS messages blocked  
- ✅ All push notifications blocked
- ✅ Only TEST_USER_EMAIL receives redirected emails
- ✅ All communications logged for audit

## 📋 Safety Logs

### What Gets Logged
- **Email attempts** with recipient, subject, and content length
- **SMS attempts** with phone number and message content
- **Push notification attempts** with user ID and content
- **User registration** events
- **Password reset** requests
- **Timestamp and environment** for all communications

### Log Format
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-11T19:33:52.179Z",
  "type": "email",
  "environment": "development", 
  "blocked": true,
  "details": {
    "to": "user@university.edu",
    "subject": "Welcome Email",
    "type": "welcome",
    "contentLength": 263
  }
}
```

## 🚀 Production Mode (Future)

### To Enable Real Communications:
**⚠️ ONLY change these when ready for production:**

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
EMAIL_SERVICE_ENABLED=true
SEND_TO_TEST_EMAIL=false
```

### Production Safety Checklist:
- [ ] Verify all test data is removed
- [ ] Confirm email templates are production-ready
- [ ] Test with small group first
- [ ] Monitor email delivery rates
- [ ] Set up proper email authentication (SPF, DKIM)

## 🔐 Security Features

### Development Protection
- **Environment-based blocking** - automatic safety based on NODE_ENV
- **Whitelist system** - only approved test emails allowed

- **Comprehensive logging** - full audit trail of blocked communications

### User Data Protection
- **No real user emails sent** during development
- **User privacy maintained** during testing
- **Data integrity preserved** while blocking communications
- **Safe user account creation** without spam risk
